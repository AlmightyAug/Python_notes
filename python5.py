#Variables
#Variables store information and they can be manipulated
#Give them some method of accessing data and hence they are given names
#Parts of computer memory to store information

#Identifiers are names given to identify something
#1st character of identifier must be a letter of alphabet (uppercase, lowercase ASCII
#or unicode character) or an underscore
#Rest of identifier name can consist of symbls, ASCII letters, unicode or digits, but no spaces please
#THEY ARE CASE SENSITIVE!!!

#Data Types
#Essentially are variables that can hold values of different types
#Create our own types using classes

#Objects
#Python is an Objected-Oriented Language
#Every variable, integer, float, string and function is an object

x = 8
y = ' is before calculation'
print(x, y)

#Assigned a literal constant value '8' to the variable x
#Assigned a phrase to the variable y

x = x * 2
y = ' is after calculation'
print(x, y)

#The value of 'x' can be overwritten after being multiplied by 2
#'y' variable can be overwritten with a new phrase of words

s = '''This a multi-line string.
This is the second line.'''
