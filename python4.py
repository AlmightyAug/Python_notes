#Escape Sequences

#Sometimes, you want to specify a string with multiple words
#Hence, you need to put the " " sign

age = 18
name = 'drathkus'

#For example you want to set a string variable with multiple words, then...

name = 'drath kus'
print (name)

#If you want to use apostrophe in your print function
print('What\'s drathkus doing on his bed?')

#If you want to use apostrophe in your print function, but you are
#triggered from the backslashes

print("What's drathkus doing on his bed?")

#If you want to split functions within the same line in your code
#that appear on 2 different lines in your programme

print('This is the first line \n This is the second line \n this is the third line')

#If you don't want a new line to be added but the string in your
#code is added to the next line, then add a backslashes

print('This is the first line \
This is the second line \
This is the third line')

#Raw String
#Strings that need not use special processing, then use the 'r' term

print(r"Newlines: drathkus's tallest monument while lying down \n ")
#Observe how the '\n' is shown, this is the raw string output
